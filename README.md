## Usage
The user interface is easy to use and intuitive but for a clear and easy usage guide, refer to the user manual here: [User Manual](https://github.com/EdanToledo/RepGraph/blob/main/UserManual.pdf)

If you simply want to use the application without the hassle of compiling and running everything locally - you can go [here](https://repgraph.vercel.app/)

For access to sample data as well as a description of Uniform Graph Interchange Format: http://mrp.nlpl.eu/2020/index.php?page=14

## Getting Started
To use the RepGraph tool is simple. All that is needed are up to date versions of the following prerequisites and Language compilers/interpreters.

* To access source code, simply clone the RepGraph repository to your local file system:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/RepGraph/RepGraph.git
```

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* Java
* Maven
* Node Package Manager
* Python 3.8.5

### Backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mvn compile
mvn package
java -jar *Location of Jar File*
```
### Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Remember to change the API endpoint in the AppContextProvider file if you want to use a locally hosted backend.
## Repository structure

```commandline
RepGraph
├── src 'contains all source code for the backend and frontend'
|   ├── main 'contains source code for the repgraph tool'

## Contribution guidelines
Please ensure that you adhere to the following guidelines when making any contributions to this repo:

- First create an issue describing the feature, improvement or bug fix. Issue wording should be clear and easy to understand.
- Create a new branch for the specific issue and prefix your branch name with the issue number followed by a few words describing the issue (e.g. `34-dark-mode`).
- Please also ensure all paths are relative and not hard coded
- For all newly created functions, please make sure to include docs
- For all newly created functions, include corresponding unit tests in the `test` folder.
- Commit any changes to your branch with an appropriate message.
- Before creating a new merge request, ensure that your commit passes all unit tests.
- Create a new merge request. Your contribution will not be accepted unless:
    1. all new functions have docs,
    2. the appropriate unit tests have been created,
    3. and your code passes all unit tests.
- Once a core member has reviewed and approved with the changes/additions you have made, your branch will be merged with `master` and will be live in the RepGraph tool.
- Please make sure old branches are deleted after they have been merged and are no longer in use.

    abstract = "We present RepGraph, an open source visualisation and analysis tool for meaning representation graphs. Graph-based meaning representations provide rich semantic annotations, but visualising them clearly is more challenging than for fully lexicalized representations. Our application provides a seamless, unifying interface with which to visualise, manipulate and analyse semantically parsed graph data represented in a JSON-based serialisation format. RepGraph visualises graphs in multiple formats, with an emphasis on showing the relation between nodes and their corresponding token spans, whilst keeping the representation compact. Additionally, the web-based tool provides NLP researchers with a clear, visually intuitive way of interacting with these graphs, and includes a number of graph analysis features. The tool currently supports the DMRS, EDS, PTG, UCCA, and AMR semantic frameworks. A live demo is available at https://repgraph.vercel.app/.",
